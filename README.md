# xkcd_terminal

So this was just a simple experiment with some 'render an image in a terminal' libraries to see if any of them were remotely good enough to produce a legible comic (i.e an xkcd one in this case).

...Turns out that's a **hard** no on whether or not this is a worthwhile endeavour.


## usage:
_assuming you've got rust installed_
* `cargo run --release` and a rando xkcd comic will appear in your terminal, you'll notice it looks shit.
